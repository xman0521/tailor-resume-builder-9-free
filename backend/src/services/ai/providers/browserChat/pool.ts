/**
 * The tabs one free chat provider may drive, and the line waiting for them.
 *
 * A chat tab holds ONE conversation, so a second prompt typed into a composer
 * that is mid-answer does not queue - it interleaves, and both answers are
 * lost. The only way to run two free calls at once is therefore two tabs, and
 * two tabs means two browsers, because a second tab in the same window is a
 * background tab and Chrome freezes those.
 *
 * So a pool is a list of browsers, one tab apiece, and a queue. How many
 * browsers a site has IS its concurrency. The queue behind them is UNBOUNDED
 * and strictly first-come-first-served: the moment any tab frees, the call at
 * the head of the line takes that tab. Nothing is refused for being late in the
 * line - a caller only ever gives up on its own deadline.
 *
 * Kept apart from `AsyncSemaphore` because the two answer different questions.
 * A semaphore hands out permission to proceed; this hands out WHICH TAB to
 * proceed on, and a caller cannot drive a browser without knowing that.

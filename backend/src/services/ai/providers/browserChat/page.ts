 * How long a single `Input.insertText` may take, given how much it carries.
 *
 * It needs its own number because the connection is opened with a
 * `protocolTimeout` of 30s (see `session.ts`), and that cap is per COMMAND for
 * every command alike - sized for a DOM read, which is milliseconds. Inserting
 * a prompt is not a DOM read. The command returns only once the page has
 * finished reacting to it, and both chat sites react a great deal: a
 * `beforeinput` handler, a rich-text model rebuilt from the new value, a React
 * render of the result, and a token estimate over the whole composer.
 *
 * That is why the FIRST call of a session worked and the second did not, which
 * is exactly what this looked like from outside. The job analysis prompt is
 * just the job description. The tailoring prompt is the profile, the analysis
 * and the keyword lists together - some 27,000 characters - and the site's
 * per-input work on it crosses 30s, so puppeteer cancelled a command the page
 * was still busy completing.
 *
 * Measured: `Input.insertText` of 64KB into a plain textarea takes 32ms, so the
 * size itself is never the cost - the page's handlers are. The budget is
 * therefore mostly a floor, with a per-character term so a genuinely enormous
 * prompt is not cut off just under the line.

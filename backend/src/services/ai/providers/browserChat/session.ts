/**
 * Attaching to a Chrome the operator started, rather than launching one.
 *
 * This is the whole design, and it is not an inconvenience to be engineered
 * away. A browser started by an automation driver announces itself as one -
 * `navigator.webdriver` is true and the build is distinctive - and sign-in
 * flows reject it; Google's answers "This browser or app may not be secure."
 * A browser the operator started is not in automation mode, and attaching to
 * it afterwards does not change that. So: they start Chrome with a debug port,
 * sign in by hand, and this connects.
 *
 *   Ubuntu:   google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
 *               --user-data-dir="$HOME/.free-tailor-chrome"
 *   Windows:  "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" ^
 *               --remote-debugging-port=9222 ^
 *               --user-data-dir="%USERPROFILE%\\free-tailor-chrome"
 *
 * A separate `--user-data-dir` is deliberate: Chrome refuses to open a debug
 * port on a profile that is already running, so without one this only works
 * when every other Chrome window is closed.

      // backgrounding flags the launcher passes.

/**
 * The environment a `claude` child process gets.
 *
 * Three removals, each closing a failure that is silent rather than loud.
 *
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` - the CLI resolves credentials
 * in a fixed order and an API key WINS over the subscription. Left in place it
 * produces identical answers at identical latency and bills every one of them,
 * which is exactly what this provider exists to avoid. This app documents
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.example` and reads it for the separate `claude`
 * HTTP provider, so it is very likely to be present.
 *
 * `CLAUDECODE` and `CLAUDE_*` - set when the server is itself launched from
 * inside a Claude Code session, which is the normal development loop. Left in
 * place the child rejoins the PARENT session: it reports the parent's session
 * id, and answers arrive contaminated by unrelated context rather than failing
 * in a way anyone would notice. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is the one exception and is
 * kept deliberately - it is where the operator's sign-in lives, and dropping it
 * signs the child out.
 *
 * `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` - the CLI's thinking budget, and the only way to set
 * one: there is no `--thinking` flag. It is dropped from the parent and set
 * from the request instead, so that whatever the operator happens to have
 * exported cannot silently override a per-profile or per-request choice.
 * Measured: with the variable unset the same prompt produced a thinking block
 * on two runs out of three, and with it set to 0 on none out of three.
 *
 * Everything else is kept on purpose. `PATH`, `HOME`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and
 * proxy variables are the operator's configuration and this module has no
 * business editing them.

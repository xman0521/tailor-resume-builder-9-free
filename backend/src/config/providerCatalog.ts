 * `browser-session` - a chat site the operator is signed in to in a Chrome
 *               they started themselves. This app stores no credential and
 *               never asks for one: it attaches to that browser over the
 *               DevTools protocol and drives the page, so the session cookie
 *               is never copied anywhere. Worth being exact about what that
 *               does and does not mean - a DevTools attachment CAN read the
 *               cookies of the browser it is attached to. Nothing here does,
 *               and the code that drives the page is right there to check, but
 *               the guarantee is "this app does not", not "this app could
 *               not". Which is why it attaches to a browser the operator
 *               started, on loopback, with a profile of its own.
